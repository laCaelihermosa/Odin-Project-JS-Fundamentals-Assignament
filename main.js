//1 Declare two variables: admin and name.
let admin;
let name;

//Assign the value "John" to name.
name = "john";

//Copy the value from name to admin.
admin = name;

alert(admin);

//alert pops up with no '' quotes inside the brackets
//when alert('admin'); ()or even double quotation alert = admin

// ('')__/ 

//2 Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
//Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?

let ourPlanetName = heart;

let currentName = "yournamehere";

//3 considering :
const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make birthday uppercase?

const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase?

//We generally use upper case for constants that are “hard-coded”. Or, in other words, when the value is known prior to execution and directly written into the code.

//In this code, birthday is exactly like that. So we could use the upper case.

//In contrast, age is evaluated in run-time. Today we have one age, a year after we’ll have another one. It is constant in a sense that it does not change through the code execution. But it is a bit “less of a constant” than birthday: it is calculated, so we should keep the lower case for it.
